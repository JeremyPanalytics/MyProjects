If you are looking for what I have done before, please start here!

## Python
### 1) Heicoders Applied Machine Learning Capstone Project <a href="https://github.com/JeremyPanalytics/MyProjects/blob/main/Jeremy_Pan_Capstone.ipynb"> Link here <a>
- <a href="https://heicodersacademy.com/AI200-applied-machine-learning-course"> AI200 Course Link </a>
- As a Loan Default Prediction Competition, I worked on predicting defaulters based on the LendingClub Loan Default Dataset on Kaggle.
- Through the course and project, I learnt how to clean and prepare data for analysis, visualise data, and use machine learning models to predict defaulters.
- The project only shows the *final* TensorFlow model I used. 
- I tried other models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests.
- 2nd Place! Won a $50 GrabFood voucher.

### 2) TensorFlow: Using Long-short term memory to predict Ripple price <a href=""> Link here </a>
